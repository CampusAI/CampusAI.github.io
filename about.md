# What is this?

This is a RL-content focus website: It contains [annotations](/lectures/) on a DeepRL course and summaries of "recent"/"famous" RL [papers](/papers/) we found interesting and soon some of our RL projects.

In addition, we also provide a comment section below each content page for readers to review/discuss/ask content-related matters.

# Who is this for?

This is for RL enthusiasts such as ourselves.

We select interesting papers and try to provide a summary which will give you a good understanding of them (deeper than what you get by just reading the abstract) in a much compressed way (by omitting technical details, previous work, and reiterations).

Ultimately (in fact, mainly) this website is also for us, to ensure we keep reading and learning.
Creating notes for [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) Deep Reinforcement Learning [course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) helped us to sort the main ideas while summarizing recent papers allows us to understand the experiments being attempted by most famous researchers.

# Who are we?

We are two [Machine Learning M.Sc.](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) students from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) very interested in Reinforcement Learning Research.
We decided to start this website in an attempt to deepen our understnding on this field.
It is a nice way of forcing ourselves be up to date with most recent developments and make our projects more presentable.

To be more precise, we are:
