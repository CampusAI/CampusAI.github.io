# What is this?

This website contains summaries of "recent" RL papers we found interesting as well as some of our RL projects.
In addition, we provide a comment section below each summary page for readers to review/discuss/ask paper-related content.

You can check out the summaries [here](papers.md), and our projects [here](projects.md)!

# Who is this for?

Have you ever wanted to keep up with latest RL research but don't have the time to go through complete papers?
Then you are in luck because this website is exacly what you want!

We select interesting papers and try to provide a summary which will give you a good understanding of them (deeper than what you get by just reading the abstract) in a much compressed way (by ommiting previous work, technical details and reiterations).

Ultimately this website is also for us, to ensure we keep learning.

# Who are we?

We are two [Machine Learning Masters](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) students from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) very interested in Reinforcement Learning Research.
In an attempt to deepen our understnding on this field we decided to start this website, forcing ourselves be up to date with most recent developments.

In particular, we are:
