## Other courses and resources

This website summarizes:
- [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) (Google, UC Berkeley): UC Berkeley CS-285 [Deep Reinforcement Learning course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

Nevertheless, we also recommend these excellent resources:
- [David Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Home.html) (DeepMind, UCL): UCL COMPM050 [Reinforcement Learning course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf), Sutton & Barto, 2017. (Arguably the most complete RL book out there)

This RL [dictionary](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-reinforcement-learning-dictionary-e16230b7d24e) can also be useful to keep track of all field-specific terms.
