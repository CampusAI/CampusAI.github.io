title: Welcome to CampusAI!
---

CampusAI is a Reinforcement Learning content website with (currently) 30+ articles distributed across:

- A [theory section](/theory/) with insights on the main research fields. It contains our annotations and personal interpretations of [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) UC Berkeley CS-285 2019 [Deep Reinforcement Learning course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). As well as pointers to other great RL resources.

- A [papers page](/papers/) with summaries on latest/influential developments in the RL world. We select interesting papers and try to provide a summary which will give you a good understanding of them (deeper than what you get by just reading the abstract) in a much compressed way (by omitting technical details, previous work, and reiterations).

- An [experiments area](/experiments) where we briefly explain some of our RL-related projects and their takeaways. We also point to the full project reports and the code for their reproducibility. 

<!-- # Who is this for?

This is for RL enthusiasts such as ourselves!
We hope you get a clearer idea on how the field is evolving.

Ultimately (in fact, mainly) this website is also for us, to ensure we keep reading and learning.
Creating theoretical articles has helped us to sort the main ideas while summarizing recent papers allows us to understand the experiments being attempted by most famous researchers. -->

# Who are we?

We are two [Machine Learning M.Sc.](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) students from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) very interested in Reinforcement Learning research.
We decided to start this website in an attempt to deepen our understanding on this field.
It is a nice way of forcing ourselves be up to date with most recent developments and make our projects more presentable.

To be more precise, we are:
