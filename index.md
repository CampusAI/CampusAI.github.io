CampusAI is a Reinforcement Learning content website with [annotations](/lectures/) and personal interpretations of [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) UC Berkeley CS-285 [Deep Reinforcement Learning course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).\\
In addition to this course, we also review and summarize interesting or influential RL-related [papers](/papers/).\\
Soon we'll include a section with our own RL projects with thoughts on the used algorithms and their meta-parameters.


# Paper of the week:

Modify your trained ANN architecture whithout the need of re-training from scratch! 
Don't miss out on this weeks featured summary: [Neural Network Surgery with Sets](/papers/NN_surgery_sets)

<!-- # Featured project:

Ever wondered how an AI can teach itself to drive a car through a maze of obstacles?
We did, check out the results:
