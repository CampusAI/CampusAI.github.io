Don't miss out on this week featured summary: [Neural Network Surgery with Sets](/papers/NN_surgery_sets)

# Featured project:

Ever wondered how an AI can teach itself to drive a car through a maze of obstacles?
We did, check out the results:

# Wanna get started in RL?

We recommend following both these great courses (available for free, given by two RL superstars):
1. [David Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Home.html) (DeepMind, UCL): UCL COMPM050 [Reinforcement Learning course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).
2. [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) (Google, UC Berkeley): UC Berkeley CS-285 [Deep Reinforcement Learning course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

This RL [dictionary]((https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-reinforcement-learning-dictionary-e16230b7d24e)) can also be useful to remember all field-specific terms.
